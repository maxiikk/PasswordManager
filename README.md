Welcome to our password generator, in development by inf2021198 &amp; inf2021221 &amp; inf2021119 for our university project

This a simple and secure app that uses AES encryption to encrypt and decrypt your passwords, it is fully offline and requires the following libraries to work (**if you run the python script and not the standalone version which has the .exe extension**):
  1. AES-Encryptor
  2. pyperclip
  3. pycryptodome

Open your command prompt (not the python idle!) and type **pip install packagename** where packagename is the name of each of the above libraries (type the names exactly as shown above)

If you have any questions or suggestions, ill be here to help
